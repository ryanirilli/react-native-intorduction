# React Native Introduction

Check out the medium post https://medium.com/points-san-francisco/learn-once-write-anywhere-996b53a343a6#.luj00q8d2 and clone this repo if you want to tinker around. There are a million of these repos out there and honestly, it's probably better if you create your own from scratch to get a feel for the nucances of building a React Native Project. But it's here if you want it. Good luck!
